# Makoto Inoue

Hello. I am a web developer with data mining and visualisation skills in Javascript and Ruby. I am always keen on learning new technologies, digging into various data, and speaking & sharing my experience at various events and conference.

## Personal Projects


- [Olympic Medal Rivalry](blog.new-bamboo.co.uk/2012/06/22/olympic-medal-rivalry)(2012)

I made an article and app to visualise countries that shared same podium in the past olympics as a chord diagram.
The app is featured in [Guardian Data blog](www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/interactive/2012/jul/03/olympics-2012-medals-share-country)

Lets user to form their own Eurozone and compare its GDP and other financial indices. Submitted to [InformationIsBeautiful](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2011/11/our-second-5000-challenge/)

- BubblyApp (2011)

This was my hack day project to visualise the mentions of each speaker in Twitter during SXSW 2011. The bottom line chart shows the number of #sxsw tweets in time series, and the bubbles represents number of mentions of each speaker during the time schedule (the schedule was scraped from lanyrd's website).

- XFactor winner prediction via Twitter(2009)

I captured the twitter feed during the final of XFactor(UK’s popular talent show) in 2009. I captured any feed related to keywords “Joe & win” , “Olly & win” or the both to represent TPS (Tweets per second) as well as ratio of which contestant (Olly Mars and Joe Mcelderry) is receives more support in the social media. Interestingly, the data was showing 6:4 to Joe even before the winner was announced. The more detail is at ["Pushing the boundary of Real Time Web with Twitter and XFactor"](http://blog.new-bamboo.co.uk/2009/12/14/pushing-the-boundary-of-real-time-web-with-twitter-and-xfactor)
